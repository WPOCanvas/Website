## Why

There are many reasons to justify why knowledge transfer is absolutely necessary. 

- The main reason behind knowledge transfer is the business continuity. Knowledge must be transferer to the new team to make sure that they can function independently. A proper focus needs to be given for knowledge retention, or in other words knowledge needs to be documented to further move away from any people dependencies. 

- A proper knowledge transfer mechanism can easily accelerate learning across the board. This could easily help faster people onboarding at anytime in the life cycle, not just in the retire stage. This could be the default for team training.

- You should consider a high investment on this topic especially if your team is a distributed team (which is not co-located). A proper knowledge transfer process may be the only effective way of learning if interaction between people are limited. Also a use of modern knowledge transfer tool can help you to bridge any language and culture gaps.

- One of the less prominent advantages of a knowledge transfer process in the increase in collaboration. Though its not directly relevant to the topic, you can also use this for your advantage when building a new team.


## How

Consider the following when you want to establish a good knowledge transfer plan.

- There are many online knowledge transfer tools available in the market. These eases off the process of both capturing and dissemination of knowledge. Moreover, language tools such as translation are built into the them, which can help immensely if your team spans across cultures. A research into use one of these tools is a good starting point.

- Once the knowledge is captured, it is also recommended to do frequent learning exercise to make sure that all relevant team members learn all relevant knowledge. It is easy to get knowledge blocks where you only concentrate on your specialty. It may be the plan in certain situation, but often knowledge dissimilation across the entire team is recommended. 

- Think about giving incentives to speed up the learning process. Some of the learning management tools are equipped with gamification techniques which gives incentives to make learning rewarding & fun; worth having a look.
