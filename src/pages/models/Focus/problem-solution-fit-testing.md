##Why?

Because it shows us that our product has the potential of scaling, and getting to product-market fit. 

before investing months or years of effort towards building a product, the first step is determining if this product is somwthing worth doing.

##How?

You have already built an MVP (minimum viable product), 
You have found your early adopters (people to use your MVP),
You have managed to solve a problem that your early adopters have, 
You have managed to charge enough for your solution so that users are happy.
