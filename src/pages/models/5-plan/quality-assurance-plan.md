1. Why?
2. Inputs?
3. Outputs
4. How?
5. Check List


##Why?

To ensure that project deliverables are of adequate quality and fit for purpose. Main components are

Quality Assurance - to ensure the quality project management process

Quality Control - via the development of quality outputs

Quality Improvement - Review points to assess and improve quality where possible

Quality assurance plan is intrested not only about the quality of end product. It also pay attention to the intermediate process and products.



##How?

Mainly Test Manager/QA lead will prepare the quality assurance plan.

##When preparing a Quality assurance plan, following steps are involved:

Ensure Quality objectives are identified.
Define QA Roles and responsibilities
Ordinate with developers, scrum masters , product owners. it should aligned with the other management activities. Risk Management, Change management, Resource management should be take into consideration.
Define methodologies and standards. - Risk management standards, project management standards, information security standards, Data protection and privacy standards, business domain related standards.
Determine QA Tasks and Time schedule.
Plan review and audit.


##Quality control - Verification and Validation

In verification and validation, mostly concern about the correctness of the product. Verification is the process of determining whether or not the products of a given phase of software development fulfill the specifications established during the previous phase. Verification activities include proving, testing, and review. Validation is the process of evaluating software at the end of the software development to ensure compliance with the software requirements.

The major V&V activities for software development are inspection, reviews, and testing. Inspection is “a formal evaluation technique in which software requirements, design or code are examined in detail by a person or a group other than the author to detect faults, violations of development standards, and other problems”. It is formal, peer evaluation of a software element whose objective is to verify that the software element satisfies its specifications and conforms to standards.



##Quality improvement : Inspections and reviews

Perform reviews for the architectural documents, requirements, test-cases, code base and other related artifacts. Quality audits also include to this phase. The aim of the inspections and reviews are to find the defects as early as possible and prevent them, improve the productivity and provide information to product monitoring purposes.



##Sample template



1.Introduction

1.1 Purpose of the SQAP

1.2 Scope - Define the primary audience for this document.

1.3 Project Objectives - Objectives of the developing software

1.4 Architectural objectives

1.5 Technical Constraints

1.6 Project Management constraints

1.7 Requirements - Where and how the requirements are coming. 



2. Reference documents - Provide a list of documents referenced elsewhere in this document. Like Requirements, Test plan, Configuration Management plan

3. Roles and Responsibilities of team members

4. Software QA requirements/Quality Objectives - Refer the requirements of the software and define objectives based on that - Usability, Maintainability , Performance, Stability, etc

5. Documentation - List down the minimum documentation that must be produced during the project - documents like

Software development plan

Test plan

Requirement documents

Architecture document

Configuration Management plan

6. Standards and guidelines - Describe any standards and guidelines that are expected to be used on the project. For example : ISO, IEEE

7. Metrics - Describe the project and process metrics

8.Review and audit plan

8.1 Work product review

Formal reviews(Demos to customer), Informal reviews (Peer reviews, Developer-tester pair testing), Quality reviews (Review document/code to ensure that Validation testing has been performed

, changes are recorded and reflect in the system)



8.2 Change request review - how does the changes handle. 

8.3 QA Progress reviews - Describe how the progress is captured , identify loop holes and improve. Ex - Retrospective meetings with the team after each release. 

8.4 Formal Audit schedules - Example ISO audits

9. Tools and Techniques : tools used in the product development and techniques used. Ex: Testing tools, Project management tools, Techniques such as - peer review, pair testing, Customer demos, Retesting and Regression testing

10. Testing Strategy - 

10.1 Define the testing approach . Unit testing, Integration testing, Functional testing (manual, automation) Non Functional testing, Acceptance testing, Regression testing

10.2 Acceptance criteria - Define the acceptance criteria in each development phase. (Unit tests passed and defined acceptance criteria for each component has been passed)

11. Training - Specify if team requires any training.

12. Risk Management - this should be a reference to the Risk Management plan
