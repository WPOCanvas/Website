description: "A product page/website is what defines the features, manufacturer, uses and a lot more, about a certain product, in e-commerce. It is a page on an e-commerce website that defines a product in its entirety. This allows the users to look deeply into what a product offers and how it will benefit them once they buy it."

##Why
The core purpose of the product website is to help a user make a decision about buying the product or skipping it. Since this page is what triggers the decision of the user, it must have a very good call-to-action and detailed information.

Here are some points to remember when designing the product website. 
- Showcase your products with high-quality images/videos
- Have unique, interesting product descriptions
- Tell visitors what to do next
- Feature customer reviews

- Be optimized for mobile/tablet
