![Product UI Theme](/img/ui-theme.jpg)

##Why
As a product team grows, its processes become more difficult to manage. Without a standardized workflow or toolkit, the team’s inefficiencies and inconsistencies will eventually work their way back into the product.

##How
All the design principles, visual assets, and patterns should be thoroughly documented.

- Create your interface inventory
  - To quickly identify current inconsistencies, start by creating an inventory of everything in your product UI: color palette, text styles, and UI patterns. The inventory is your strongest tool for selling the need for a design system.
- Get buy-in from the team
  - As you present the inconsistencies reflected in your interface in- ventory, emphasize the ROI of the design system.
- Define your design principles
  - Before you build your new system, create a set of general prin- ciples for a coherent experience. What universal values should designers to keep in mind?
- Unify your visual design
  - Think about the most fundamental and repetitive patterns in your interface. Colors, text-styles, icons will probably come to mind first. Perhaps also some interactive patterns (hover on clickable elements), border visual properties, or maybe animations? Discuss with the team to decide which version of these elements will be canonical. Then, document them as part of the system.
- Create your interactive component library
  - Once you have the foundation well-defined, start adding your approved interface patterns to the shared library. Keep them up- dated and encourage the team to use them in every subsequent project - your efficiency and consistency will improve drastically.
