description: "Themes are groupings of similar features, epics or initiatives. Ideally, themes describe customer value – what customers are going to be receiving or the job that you’ll help them accomplish. For example, “improve shopping cart experience” is an example of a customer-focused theme, and into this theme you would group the initiatives that support it."

##Why
Building your product roadmap to convey your vision in a compelling way is challenging. But by grouping initiatives together into themes, you can organize your roadmap in a way that describes the value to customers and other stakeholders. Themes can help you put together a roadmap that creates a story

##How

- Your company’s long-term strategic initiatives are a good way of identifying roadmap themes. You can pick a handful of high-level initiatives you want to accomplish
- If you are agile, themes can contain one or more epics. They are rarely feature-specific.
- Education is an important part of communicating the roadmap – educating stakeholders about how you define the theme, how you are measuring success, and of course providing some detail about what is included in the theme.
