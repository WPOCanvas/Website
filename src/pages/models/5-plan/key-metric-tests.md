description: "Software Testing Metric is be defined as a quantitative measure that helps to estimate the progress, quality, and health of a software testing effort. A Metric defines in quantitative terms the degree to which a system, system component, or process possesses a given attribute. The ideal example to understand metrics would be a weekly mileage of a car compared to its ideal mileage recommended by the manufacturer."

##Why
Software testing metrics or software test measurement is the quantitative indication of extent, capacity, dimension, amount or size of some attribute of a process or product. Testing key metrics helps to take decisions for the next phase of of activities in case of technology or the process change. They act as evidenve of the cliam or prediction.

##How
There are three main types of testing metrics

- Process Metrics
  - It can be used to improve the process efficiency of the SDLC ( Software Development Life Cycle)
- Product Metrics
  - It deals with the quality of the software product
- Project Metrics
  - It can be used to measure the efficiency of a project team or any testing tools being used by the team members

Once the correct testing metric is identified, you may follow these steps

- Identify the key software testing processes to be measured
  - E.g. Testing progress tracking process
- The tester uses the data as a baseline to define the metrics
  - E.g. The number of test cases planned to be executed per day
- Determination of the information to be followed, a frequency of tracking and the person responsible
  - E.g. The actual test execution per day will be captured by the test manager at the end of the day
- Effective calculation, management, and interpretation of the defined metrics
  - E.g. The actual test cases executed per day
- Identify the areas of improvement depending on the interpretation of defined metrics
  - E.g. The Test Case execution falls below the goal set, we need to investigate the reason and suggest the improvement measures
