##Why
A go to market strategy serves a couple of purposes. First, it clarifies why you’re launching your product, who it’s for, and how you’re going to tackle the never-easy job of getting them to engage with and buy it. Second, it forces you to think through all the issues your customers will face when presented with your product. This helps make sure you can give them the best experience possible and build trust with them

##How

- Identify the buying center and personas
  - Roughly there are seven roles
    - Initiator: Starts the buying process or shows initial interest
    - User: Uses your product regularly
    - Influencer: Convinces others the product is needed
    - Decision maker: gives final approval for the purchase
    - Buyer: Owns the budget
    - Approver: Final approver who pushes the initiative on a larger scale
    - Gatekeeper: Blocker in getting a product implemented or approved
- Map a value matrix and messaging strategy to each persona
  - A value matrix is a breakdown of each buying center persona, their business problems, how your product is valuable in solving those problems, and a relevant marketing message tying the problem and solution together.
- Understand your buyer’s journey
  - With your personas and value matrix built, dive deeper to understand the journey a potential customer will take, both from the buyer’s perspective and from the perspective of your company.
- Pick a sales strategy
- Generate interest
- Create content
- Optimize
