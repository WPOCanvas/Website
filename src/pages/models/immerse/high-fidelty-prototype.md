##What is high-fidelity prototyping?

The fidelity of the prototype refers to the level of details and functionality built into a prototype. In this sense, a high-fidelity (sometimes referred as high-fi or hi-fi) prototype is a computer-based interactive representation of the product in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality. The “high” in high-fidelity refers to the level of comprehensiveness that allows you to examine usability questions in detail and make conclusions about the user behaviour.

The hi-fi prototypes cover not only the user interface (UI) of the product in terms of visuals and aesthetics, but also the user experience (UX) aspects in terms of interactions, user flow and behaviour.



##When?

So, when is the right time to use hi-fi prototypes?

When you have visual designs of your product
When you have an idea about interactive elements, such as navigational schemas from a screen to another; animations; and mini-interactions, and are able to prototype them
When you want to test the details of your products in terms of UI elements, colour schemes or copy
When you want to test the transitions, animations, and effects of them on the user and user behaviour
When you want to know how your target users feel about your product and you want to get their opinions on your designs.


##Why?

The main purpose of interactive prototypes is their use in the usability testing of the product have target users validate it. It is important to test your product before launching it in the market to foresee any issues or failures. Getting the most out of the feedback can be done with a prototype that is closest to the final product in its detail and functionality.

In addition to validating designs, interactive prototypes can be used for presentations and pitches. When you want to communicate the designs and functionalities of your product to your team members, clients or other stakeholders in the project, and when the functional build of the software is not developed, a high-fidelity prototype does the job very well.

There are multiple benefits of using high-fidelity prototypes in product design:



Interactive prototypes are made as close to the true graphical representation of the products as they can to allow thorough testing on all the detailed aspects, including UI components, colours, layouts, the information hierarchy, mental load of the screens on users, and other interactions.
They provide a good base in terms of project management for making estimates on how much time is needed for implementation and quality assurance testing
The availability of interactive prototypes can improve the collaboration with developers as they will have a clearer idea on how the application should behave
Most importantly, by allowing you to test your product, the prototypes can save the company the cost in terms of time and money on building something that would have had little success in the market.




##How? Materials and methods.

In order to create an interactive prototype, you need to get all your ingredients ready. First of all, prepare your visuals and set your user flows. Identify all the transitions and animations you want to create between different objects or screens. Finally, choose the right tool according to your needs. There is a growing list of prototyping tools available for designers.

Some of the top mobile and web software prototyping tools currently in the industry are:

Proto.io
InVision
Pixate
Axure
Principle
Form
Framer
Adobe XD 


The web has enough information on comparing pros and cons of each tool that we do not want to repeat again here. Although, what is important to mention here is that when choosing your most optimal prototyping tool, you need to base your decisions on practical considerations:



Aesthetics of the produced prototype, in terms of visuals and interactions giving a native feeling; how fluid the animations are, and so on.
The availability of established interaction models in the software that you can use to drag and drop in order to create your prototypes quickly
Handling of assets, in terms of syncing with popular cloud-based platforms, ease of storing and searching assets in the software, and ease of updating all instances when changing the source asset.
Compatibility with Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch or any of your favourite tools to generate visuals
Ability to preview your prototypes across different-sized devices and platforms
Playback speed
Publishing capabilities to enable sharing with your clients and other stakeholders
Availability of library with common UI elements to aid creating quick screens
Collaboration, in terms of allowing colleagues or others to comment or feedback on features
