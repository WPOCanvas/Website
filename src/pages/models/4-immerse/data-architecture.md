##Why
Data architecture provides clarity about every aspect of the data, which enables data scientists to work with trustable data efficiently and to solve complex business problems. It also prepares an organization to quickly take advantage of new business opportunities by leveraging emerging technologies and improves operational efficiency by managing complex data and information delivery throughout the enterprise.

##How
A successful enterprise needs to have a top-down coherent data architecture designed based on the business processes and operations. Usually there are three different layers for a data architecture.
- Conceptual Level Data Architecture Design based on Business Process and Operations
  - It should include,
    - The core data entities and data elements such as those about customers, products, sales
    - The output data needed by the clients and customers.
    - Security policies to be applied to each data entity.
    - The relationships between the data entities, such as reference integrity, business rules, execution sequence.
    - Standards of data quality, operations, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Logical Level Data Architecture Design
  - It should consider,
    - Type of database and the data format to use e.g. NoSQL, Relational
    - The naming conventions and data integrity
    - Data archival/retention policies
    - Privacy and security information
    - Data Replications
    - Data Flows and Pipelines
- Physical/technology model
  - Provides the data mechanism for a specific process and functionality, or how the actual data architecture is implemented on underlying technology infrastructure
