##Why
If you want your business to succeed, you need to build products that your target customers really want. Building a product your customer really wants means you have found your product market fit.

“The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers.” which is what we all want for our business.

##How

According to Steve Blank, there are four stages before finding a product-market fit — four stages that a startup business has to pass through, to discover the scale potential of its business model. These stages are:

- Stage 1
  - The Customer Discovery at which you get ready to sell. In this stage you prepare your company for scalability, you create a road-map and develop a high fidelity MVP, based on your customer’s feedback.
- Stage 2
  - The Customer Validation where you get out of the building. When you start “test selling.”
- Stage 3
  - The Customer Creation where you develop positioning and decide on your brand and product positioning.
- Stage 4
  - The Verification when you verify that what you’ve done so far, the customer feedback that you have, the positioning you’ve chosen and everything in between, is right.

### How to Measure?

“Asking if you’ve found product-market fit, is like asking: how do you know when you are in love — trust me, you know.” - Emmett Shear

As an overview you could say you found the product market fit when:

- The demand for your products and services is excessively high,
- When your user base is growing,
- When you have people, who are engaged with your products.

Few practical ways to measure product-market fit is:

- Net Promoter Score
- Retention Curve
- Product Usage Interval
- Growth Rate
