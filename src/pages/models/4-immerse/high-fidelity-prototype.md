description: "A high fidelity prototype is a computer-based interactive representation of the product in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality. The hi-fi prototypes cover not only the user interface (UI) of the product in terms of visuals and aesthetics, but also the user experience (UX) aspects in terms of interactions, user flow and behaviour."

##Why

The main purpose of interactive prototypes is their use in the usability testing of the product have target users validate it. It is important to test our product before launching it in the market to foresee any issues or failures. Getting the most out of the feedback can be done with a prototype that is closest to the final product in its detail and functionality.

In addition to validating designs, interactive prototypes can be used for presentations and pitches. When we want to communicate the designs and functionalities of our product to our team members, clients or other stakeholders in the project, and when the functional build of the software is not developed, a high fidelity prototype does the job very well.

##How

In order to create good high fidelity prototype, we need to get all our ingredients ready. Followings are the prerequisites that required for quality outcome.  

- Prepare required visuals and user flows
- Identify all the transitions and animations that need to create between different objects or screens 
- Choose the right tool that fulfilling our requirements 

When selecting a proper tool for crating a high fidelity prototype, the web has enough information on comparing pros and cons of different type of tools that we can used for this. But, what is important here is that when choosing the most optimal prototyping tool, we need to base our decisions on practical considerations such as:

- Aesthetics of the produced prototype, in terms of visuals and interactions giving a native feeling; how fluid the animations are, and so on.
- The availability of established interaction models in the software that we can use to drag and drop in order to create our prototypes quickly
- Handling of assets, in terms of syncing with popular cloud-based platforms, ease of storing and searching assets in the software, and ease of updating all instances when changing the source asset.
- Compatibility with Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch or any of our favorite tools to generate visuals
- Ability to preview our prototypes across different-sized devices and platforms
- Playback speed
- Publishing capabilities to enable sharing with our clients and other stakeholders
- Availability of library with common UI elements to aid creating quick screens
- Collaboration, in terms of allowing colleagues or others to comment or feedback on features
