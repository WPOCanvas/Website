description: "A high-fidelity(hi-fi) prototype is a computer-based interactive representation of the product in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality. The hi-fi prototypes cover not only the user interface (UI) of the product in terms of visuals and aesthetics, but also the user experience (UX) aspects in terms of interactions, user flow and behaviour."

##Why
The main purpose of interactive prototypes is their use in the usability testing of the product have target users validate it. It is important to test your product before launching it in the market to foresee any issues or failures. There are multiple benefits of using high-fidelity prototypes in product design.

- Interactive prototypes are made as close to the true graphical representation of the products as they can to allow thorough testing on all the detailed aspects, including UI components, colours, layouts, the information hierarchy, mental load of the screens on users, and other interactions.

- They provide a good base in terms of project management for making estimates on how much time is needed for implementation and quality assurance testing

- The availability of interactive prototypes can improve the collaboration with developers as they will have a clearer idea on how the application should behave

- Most importantly, by allowing you to test your product, the prototypes can save the company the cost in terms of time and money on building something that would have had little success in the market.

##How

- Prepare your visuals and set your user flows
- Identify all the transitions and animations you want to create between different objects or screens
- Choose the right tool according to your needs. There is a growing list of prototyping tools available for designers. Some of the top mobile and web software prototyping tools currently in the industry are,
  - Proto.io
  - InVision
  - Pixate
  - Axure
  - Principle
  - Form
  - Framer
  - Adobe XD
