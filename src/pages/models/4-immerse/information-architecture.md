##Why
Information Architecture is a methodology where we create a skeleton of the whole product. It will have the following elements on it.

- Visual Elements
- Functionality
- Interaction
- Navigation

Having these elements in the Information Architecture avoids having in-explicit navigation, making users lost or feel annoyed using the system. Avoiding such things in the system, we minimize the risk of user faces first bad interaction and leave the product without event giving a second chance.

Good information architecture is the foundation of efficient user experience, so the IA skill is essential for the designers. Effective IA makes the product easy to use but only united with design thinking the product has the powerful user experience.

##How
Letâ€™s see what these components are and how we can design each of these components and create the Information architecture of the product.

- Organization Systems
  Here it is designed the groups are categories which information is divided. There are 3 main organization structures.

  - Hierarchical
  - Sequential
  - Matrix

- Labeling Systems
- Navigation Systems
- Searching Systems
