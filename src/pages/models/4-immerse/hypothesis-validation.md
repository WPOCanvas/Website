description: "Once you have a good idea about what needs to be built, you need to validate that the features are valuable to the end users. It is a waste of time and effort to build a product that does not solve problems which no one has. Hypothesis validation helps us to pick the most sought out features to add a higher value to the product, while managing the risk at a lower level"

##Why
Startups often fail because they build solutions for non-existing problems. Hypothesis validation helps validate that a feature or even a full product is actually solving a problem in the market.
Hypothesis validation also allows to pivot features from solving one problem to another that we have not seen so far. This eventually leads to better features that are useful to the product.
A hypothesis driven model helps us to define measurable outcomes; along with time and cost factors for them. These models also help us to manage risks as there are clear and quantifiable results. Even if a hypothesis is invalidated eventually, this process produces empirical lessons about the market, customers, competitors and their products.

##How

- BML model
- Setting up specialist innovation teams with a focus on validating features
- Form the hypothesis
- Select a testing method
- Set the goals (success criteria)
- Run the test and analyse the results
- Use of tools
