##Why
Startups often fail because they build solutions for non-existing problems. Hypothesis validation helps validate that a feature or even a full product is actually solving a problem in the market.
Hypothesis validation also allows to pivot features from solving one problem to another that we have not seen so far. This eventually leads to better features that are useful to the product.

##How

- BML model
- Setting up specialist innovation teams with a focus on validating features
- Form the hypothesis
- Select a testing method
- Set the goals (success criteria)
- Run the test and analyse the results
