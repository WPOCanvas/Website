##Why
The ultimate goal is to identify positions in the market that represents unmet needs. If your product fills those needs better than any other product, you will be naturally differentiated from the competition.

##How
Marketers must take into account each of the following when positioning.

- Premise
  - Companies often must be willing to lose customers when position a product. E.g. When a radio station changes formats they will create a new position, often lose current listeners.
- Long-term
  - The positioning must be able to work for a long period of time. Generally, positioning should not be done on technological innovation as this can be copied or improved on.
- Relevent
  - The positioning must be relevent to the consumer rather than to the company.
- Clear and Coherent
  - The positioning needs to be obvious to the customer.
- Distinctive
  - The positioning must allow the consumer to see the company as distinctive to be effective

Types of product positioning

- Benefit
  - Created by the benefits offered by the product. E.g. The fuel economy of a hybrid car
- Target
  - The positioning should make the consumer think that product belongs to them, not to others
- Price
  - High pricing can position the product as a luxury, attracting high-end consumers. Low pricing also positions products. Medium pricing cannot be used for positioning as there are too many other products in the same range.
- Distribution
  - Some products are only sold at certain locations/stores
- Service
  - Various services offered help to position a product. E.g. Open 24/7. "No Hassle" return policy
