###Persona

The Persona definition is that one or several fictional characters that can represent the majority of the potential users of product with conventional user demands and they are created through a great amount of quantitative and qualitative research. Persona answers the question “Who do we design for?” It is a powerful tool based on research findings in helping product function creation by optimizing the UX research and it not only represents a specific user but all of them, it can be understood as a typical character of the behavior, cognition and perception of all potential users.

##Why?
Numerous research data for product design are quite difficult to handle, especially when we need to pay attention to the data throughout the entire process. Therefore, Persona will be a relatively more realistic and concrete object, although not a real person, it is the most typical image of many real Personas. And it can remind us of the users’ needs and help us make a better user experience model because of which real users will feel more comfortable while using product. This is why it can facilitate the development.



Examination of the comprehension about users: The more the design group knows about their users, the more users need their products
Users centered: Personas demonstrate the goals and requirements of users: the axis of the work for UX design group, which will make the first version of product come with better usability design;
To avoid conflict: With Personas, when appears conflict of design, the design group can adapt their decision based on the model.
Management control: Personas can help the group develop the most useful functions instead of designing functions that will never be used. And avoid the usual situation that developers misunderstand what users want because there is the difference between what they say and do.
Prediction of user behavior: Taking advantage of Personas can predict the needs, behavior and possible reactions of users, that is why they can reduce the use of the usability exam.
Design ranking adjusts: Personas will help the product team figure out the most important design element.
Time-saving: Personas is a way to replace some traditional user demands research method.


##Inputs & How


The team can gather with the stakeholders of the product to define the input areas of the persona mentioned below. The information does not need to be accurate at the beginning and should not spent more than a couple of hours for one persona.



The first step would be to identify the user groups. Who are the main type of users of the particular product. To start off things start with not more that 3 personas. The more user-groups you try to design for your design would get complicated.



Include a fictional name and the picture of your first persona. Use empathy to follow through the sections.



Filter and categorize Think and Feel, Say and do, Hear and See in to pain points and goals.

##When & Where
A good Persona can offer support to the group in the UX research and the final destination is to create a product with great UX. Besides, with the foundation of Personas, the group can react more quickly when user requirements change. A professional and fast prototyping tool also help the design group to create an outstanding prototype with well-designed UX. But Persona should be able to lead the group to optimize the function design throughout the entire development. That is why the combination of both parties can greatly promote product design and this function will be sustainable. However, the creation of a good Persona is not simple, its characteristics are



1. Sufficiently reflect the data and conclusions of investigations;

2. Show the current state of the interviewees instead of their expectation of the future;

3. Be more realistic than idealistic;

4. Propose a challenge to the group (but it is not impossible);

5. Help the group understand the users better.



##Outputs
Goals of the user group.

Pain points needs to be solved from the product

These will define the features needed to be developed in the product.



User Journey map


User journey map is a visualization of an individual’s relationships with a product/brand over time and across different channels.While user journey maps come in all shapes and formats, commonly it’s represented as a timeline of all touch points between a user and a product. This timeline contains information about all channels that users use to interact with a product.



‘How do people actually use our product?’ is a fundamental question that every product creator must answer. In order to answer this question, product designers need to understand the essence of the whole experience from the user’s perspective. User journey mapping is an excellent exercise that can shed light on that.



## Why?
User journey map is an excellent tool for UX designers because It visualizes how a user interacts with a product and allows designers to see a product from a user’s point of view This fosters a more user-centric approach to product design, which ultimately leads to better user experience.

User journey map helps a product team to find the answer to the “What if..?” questions. Also, a user journey map can be helpful when the company tracks quantitative KPIs. In this case, a user journey map has an opportunity to become a cornerstone for strategic recommendations.
