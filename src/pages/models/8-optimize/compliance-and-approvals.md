description: "Product compliance means there is evidence that the product meets the essential legal requirements. It is important that product managers understand the difference between quality and compliance. Nearly all industries and countries have standards, regulations that related software products must comply with. So, keeping software products compliant is no small effort.
Product certification or product qualification (approvals) is the process of certifying that a certain product has passed performance tests and quality assurance tests, and meets qualification criteria stipulated in contracts, regulations, or specifications (sometimes called "certification schemes" in the product certification industry).
Most common software product compliances include:
ISO 27001, the international standard for an ISMS (information security management system), provides best practice for an ISMS, a systematic approach consisting of people, processes and technology that helps you protect and manage all the organization’s information through risk management.
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires products/operations to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures – including policies, procedures and processes – to protect the personal data it processes."

- Mitigate risks:  Systematic risk management covering people, processes and technology
- Cost optimization: Optimized costs via optimizing processes. Avoid the financial penalties and losses associated with data breaches.
- Win new business: Meet strict client demands for greater data security.
- Brand reputation:  Demonstrate that the product is of high quality and can be used with confidence
