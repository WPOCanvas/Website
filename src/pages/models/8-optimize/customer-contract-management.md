description: "A contract is a written or oral legally-binding agreement between the parties identified in the agreement to fulfill the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement.
Contracts can be of many types. A few examples would be - sales contracts (including leases), purchasing contracts, partnership agreements, trade agreements, and intellectual property agreements.

##whyA contract specifies the activities entered into by both parties planning to do business together and the terms through which they will each fulfill their parts of the agreement. Contracts affect business profitability in a very large way due to the emphasis on revenue and expenses.
When a contract management strategy is successfully implemented, organizations can expect to see:
- The expected business benefits and financial returns are being realized.
- The supplier being cooperative and responsive to the organization's needs.
- The organization encountering no contract disputes or surprises.
- The delivery of services being satisfactory to both parties.
When a contract is phrased poorly, an organization might incur huge financial losses over a simple matter.



##howThere are nine steps in the contract management process. 
- Invitation to Treat - The contract management process begins when businesses issue an "invitation to treat." This legal term simply means that the business is willing to receive offers on products or services.

-	Authoring contracts - Once an invitation to treat is apparent, the business may accept bids on the potential contract. The business now can begin to write the contract based on terms and conditions suitable for the arrangement.

-	Negotiating the contract - Negotiation often occurs simultaneously with authoring the contract. Both sides of the agreement discuss the terms and conditions and decide on a mutually agreeable set of promises and obligations.

-	Acceptance - The instance in which most bottlenecks occur is getting management approval. Users can pre-emptively combat this by creating tailored approval workflows, including parallel and serial approvals to keep decisions moving at a rapid pace.

-	Execution - Parties that accept a contract typically do something to signify the acceptance. This is called execution. In a written contract, execution happens as both parties sign the contract, often in front of a witness.

-	Ensuring Compliance - The contract manager or business owner must ensure that all of the terms and conditions in the contract are being met by both parties. If one party fails to live up to their side of the bargain, the other party can sue for breach of contract, which can be costly.

-	Revisions and Amendments - Sometimes, one or both parties bound by the contract deem it necessary to change its terms or conditions. In these instances, a new contract typically is issued.

-	Auditing and Reporting - Contract management is not limited to drafting a contract and then pushing it into the filing cabinet without another thought. Contract audits play a crucial role in determining both organizations' compliance with the terms of the agreement and any possible problems that might arise.

-	Renewal - If the parties involved wish to continue doing business, it would be required to periodically review and renew the contract. It may be required to repeat the contract process to ensure that everyone is on the same page about compensation, terms and conditions.
