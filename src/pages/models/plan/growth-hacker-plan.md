Growth hacking is a technique of accelerating growth in terms of customers, beyond conventional means and pace of growth.
Usually growth hacking comes in handy when you desire a certain level of growth but you don’t have the necessary resources (i.e: time and money) to do it in traditional means.
Growth hacking is a result of collaborative power of many teams within your organization such as Marketing, Product, Engineering and Sales.
In traditional growth process, the engineering team develops the features prioritized by the product team and the marketing team together the sales teams use their own ways to achieve growth targets (i.e: increase the number of users). But in growth hacking, all these teams get together and conduct rapid experiments to increase growth at each stage. These experiments would usually demand skills and expertise of all these teams and unlikely to be possible without the collaboration.
Growth hacking activities are rapid experiments which are data driven. You explore your customer acquisition funnel and identify stages in the funnel where you could use un-natural pace of growth. Your experiments would be focused on to increase growth these identified stage(s) using unconventional methods (hence the word hacking).
Growth hacks that has been successfully executed, usually have a viral nature built into the method.
It is often misperceived that growth hack is only relevant to customer acquisition. Growth hacking applies to all 6 stages of the “Pirate Tunnel”, nominally; awareness, acquisition, activation, retention, revenue and referral. (Fun fact: It’s called Pirate Tunnel because first six letters of the stages becomes AAARRR!)

###Example cases of Growth Hacking: 

##1. Dropbox

Initially Dropbox tried social media and online marketing to increase the number of users visiting their site and register for the product. Their marketing cost was 350 $ per customer. This is a traditional marketing approach.

This approach did not bring them the expected results (cost was too high to sustain). Their growth hacking experiment of getting users to invite 5 friends to sign-up for the service, resulting both inviter and invitee gaining free storage space worked very well - in fact it was a 28% increase from their traditional approach. Executing this would only be possible when marketing, product and engineering teams would have to come together to ideate and implement such experiments.



##2. Airbnb

When Airbnb started they were struggling to get users onboard. Users were heavily using classified sites such as Craiglist. Airbnb reverse engineered Craiglist’s ad-posting process to introduce a feature for Airbnb home-owners, where home-owners can post their Airbnb ad with one click onto Craiglist. When an accommodation seeker on Craiglist clicks on the post it takes him to Airbnb. By the time Craiglist realizes what is happening, Airbnb already had their user base created. As per Craiglist policies, this was within legal and ethical boundaries and by collaboration of multiple departments (probably including legal) Airbnb was able to gain unconventional advantage in growth.



##3. Listerine

When Listerine is introduced to they got saturated at the customer base who worries about bad-breath - which is more of a cosmetic issue. Then they took the latin word “halitus” (means bad-breath) and added postfix “osis” to create “halitosis” which sounded like a disease. After several marketing campaigns their sales were incredibly high because the number of people motivated to avoid a disease is much higher than the number of people who are motivated towards cosmetic reasons.











##Where to start?
Identify the Pirate Tunnel for your product with good understanding of each stage and statistics associated with them.
Do some homework within the team! Come up with a few possible ideas for Growth hacking - just to warm up and make sure everyone’s on the same page.
Educate your customer and organize a meeting involving few stakeholders across different teams (marketing, product, engineering).
Discuss each stage of Pirate Tunnel and experiments that you could do to create growth.
Iterate through Build-Measure-Learn cycles to conduct and measure the success of experiments to reach desired growth.




###Caveats
It is important that you have already done your product validation and have found your Product Market Fit before you start Growth hacking. Trying to growth hack a product that doesn’t fit the market, could likely to fail and you would mistakenly attribute failures to the growth hack experiments without realizing the real issue is with your Product Market Fit. 
Using unconventional methods, sometimes could lean towards areas of ambiguity in the light of ethics. As we are an ethical organization, always be mindful of what you suggest, recommend and execute, since it should be legal and ethical in terms of all social contexts (local and foriegn) that we operate.
Growth hacking methods quickly lose their novelty and become conventional hence ineffective. Copying a growth hack method (unless you do it fast enough) or repeating the same method often tend to be fruitless.
