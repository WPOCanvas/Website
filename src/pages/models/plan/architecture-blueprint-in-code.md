###What is Architecture Blueprint in Code?




##1. Why?
In order for the success factors of a winning product to be met, 'effective' design (and thereby 'effective' architecture is required). Every software product ever developed has a design, whether intentional or taking the no-design approach. The difference being, there can be good design, bad design, and alternatively, 'effective' design.
(Emphasis added) - "A word closely related to good is effective, and it possibly more accurately states what we should strive for in software design: effective design. Effective design meets the needs of the business organization to the extent that it can distinguish itself from its competition by means of software. Effective design forces the organization to understand what it must excel at, and is used to guide the creation of the correct software model" [1]
Discrepancy between architecture and business strategy: Architecture was generally a technical execution-only phase and/or considered part of a project delivery role. In contrast, in product engineering, and especially in formulating a winning product strategy, effective architects should get the strategy to match with execution. This may entail the architect to be versatile and knowledgeable in delivering against a business architecture and its artifacts [2] 


##2. Inputs?
What is architecture and design, in the context of the winning product canvas?
“You might ask: Where does (software) architecture start and end? To answer that, we need to answer: What is architecture? Architecture isn’t a sub-process, but a product of a process – a process called design. Design is the act of solving a problem” [3]


##3. Outputs
Lean architecture driven by an effective design process, that can accommodate the proponents of the winning product canvas. If the architecture is not compatible and cannot play well with the requirements, activities, learning, and outcomes, of the sibling processes in the winning product canvas, then it is a failure and constraints the underlying purpose of the winning product canvas.
