Once you have a clear understanding of your value proposition, the next step in the Lean Product Process is to decide on the feature set for your minimum viable product (MVP) candidate. You are not going to start off by designing a new product that delivers on your full value proposition, since that would take too long and be too risky. For your MVP, you want to identify the minimum functionality required to validate that you are heading in the right direction. We call this an MVP candidate instead of an MVP because it is based on your hypotheses. You haven't yet validated with customers that they agree that it is, in fact, a viable product.

Product and services identified through Gain Creators and Pain Relievers are the potential feature set of your new product. You may now further categorize them using your knowledge of competitor products and services into:



#Basic: Basic features required by any product in the domain

#Performance Advantage: Features that are available with competitors, but your product has better performance

#Differentiator: Unique value features offered by your product



Now you may roughly calculate the ROI of each of the feature. Once ROI is known, it is easier to pick features for your 'Minimal Viable Product' releases. There are 3 criteria you may consider in selecting features for early MVP releases.

Features with higher ROI
Important unique features that require early validation of underline hypothesises
Basic features that need be present in order to provide other functionalities


For an example analysis, please see the below table.
