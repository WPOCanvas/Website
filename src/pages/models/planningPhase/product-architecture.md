Product Architecture is based on the foundational concepts of general software architecture (refer Architecture and Design model) and this model goes beyond in order to define it under following attributes which would further sustain as a product;

Unlike in typical software architecture where it certain architectural patterns are optional and will be considered based on the functional and nonfunctional aspects of software, in Software product space every product needs to have tactics to accommodate following critical success factors. However one can chose the level of design to accommodate following aspects.



Feature Lifecycle Management
Support
Licensing Management
Multi-tenancy




#Design for Feature Lifecycle Management

In contrast to typical Software application features in the software product is what gives the ISV (Independent Software Vendor) unique value in the market space. Hence managing product features becomes a critical aspects in the product and its Product Architect's role to build design within the product to facilitate feature lifecycle.



Tactics:





#Design for Support

Software product needs to be design and implemented for support from very early on in the project lifecycle. Good example is continuous delivery tools and patterns. In order to provide quick feature testing engineering teams must be able to release features in small chunks and get feedback as soon as possible and when required team should be able to bring the features offline (feature toggling). Another example of this is to designing the products to track and send user behavioural statistics back to development team so that they will be able to improve the user experience.


Tactics:





#Licensing Management

Every product needs to be able to sell its features for designated price and be able to receive payments on time to sustain the product development. Modern products tent to have complex mix and match of features geared to attract different markets using same product base. ISVs would want to introduce new features into the product suite, roll-out to selected users, package features into editions, establish a invoicing policy, define invoicing policy, self signup, and integrate a payment gateway.



Tactics:





#Multi-tenancy

When designing products one of the common deployments models is to deploy one instance of the software and provide the software as a service thereby sharing all the system resources by all the tenants (customer organizations). In this model ISV is able to reduce the cost of customer acquisition drastically and is able to reach out to long-tail (large number of smaller customers).
