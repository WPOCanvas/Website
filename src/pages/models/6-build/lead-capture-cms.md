description: "In most CRM systems, the term lead capture designates a process of saving lead information in order to attempt converting the lead to a paying customer. An example of a lead capture page or a lead capture form is a newsletter subscription or a quote request form on a website. Lead name, email address and phone numbers are usually captured, although complex web forms may contact much more information, such as company size, industry, title of the person, postal address and so on."

![Lead Capture](/img/lead-generation.jpg)

##Why
A lead is simply the contact information of a prospective customer or action taker. Capturing customer details allows you to continue to market to them as they move down your funnel, where you can educate, build trust and convert your visitors into customers.

##How
Most common lead capture mechanisms are as follows. You may use a tool like Hubspot to help you in the process.

- Web to lead
  - Make use of a lead capture page or a lead capture form in your website.
- Call to lead
  - An incoming phone call to a company's number is automatically entered as a new lead, unless it's already in the database
- Email to lead
  - An incoming email to a company's email address (such as info@company.com or sales@company.com) is automatically entered as a new lead, unless it's already in the database.
- Social to lead
  - An incoming message, question or comment via social network or messenger (such as Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Skype, WhatsApp) is automatically entered as a new lead, unless it's already in the database
