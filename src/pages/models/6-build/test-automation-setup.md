description: "Automated Testing is a software testing technique which can test and compare the actual outcome against the expected result. Test automation requires considerable about of human involevement until the test suite is created. Once the test suite is created no human intervention is needed. So this reduces the time and cost of testing"

##why(word count 200)
<!-- {paragraph} -->
Test automation has become very much important due to the following reasons.
  - Manual testing for all workflows would be costly and time consuming
  - Does not need human intervention 
  - Automation increases the speed of execution
  - Increases test coverage
  - Manual testing can be boring and error prone
When automating test cases the selection should be based on the following criteria
  - High risk and business critical test cases
  - Repeatedly executed test cases
  - Test cases which are difficult to perform manually
  - Time consuming test cases
  SHOULD NOT 
  - take ad hoc test cases
  - Frequently changing test cases

##how(in bullet points)

Test automation process can be defined as follows
  1. Test tool selection
  2. Define the scope of selection
  3. Planning, design and development
  4. Test execution
  5. Maintenance

  1. Test tool selection
    Tool selection is the foremost important step that needs to follow as some applications do not support for some tools. It is adivisable to conduct a proof of concept on the application with regards to the test automation tool.
  2. Define the scope of selection
    The scope of the area of the application that intends to conduct test automation should be considered based on the following.
      - Import features for the business
      - Areas that have large amount of data
      - Common functionalities
      - Technical feasibility
      - The complexity of test cases
      - Ability to use the same test cases for cross-browser testing
  3. Planning, design and development
    Automation strategy and plan should be made as follows
      - Automation tools selected
      - Framework design and its features
      - In-Scope and out-scope items of automation
      - Automation test bed preparation
      - Schedule and timeline of scripting and execution
      - Deliverables of test automation
  4. Test execution
    In this phase test automation should be run with test input data and after the execution detailed test reports should be generated
  5. Maintenance
    As new functionalities added automation scripts need to be added, reviewed and maintained for each release cycle.
