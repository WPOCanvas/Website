description: "Automated Testing is a software testing technique which can test and compare the actual outcome against the expected result. Test automation requires considerable about of human involevement until the test suite is created. Once the test suite is created no human intervention is needed. So this reduces the time and cost of testing"

##Why
Businesses are nowadays adopting DevOps and Cloud Computing. DevOps makes the team agile as well as focuses on delivering value and changing the dynamics of development, operation, and quality assurance teams. Cloud computing has changed software in service. To increase the effectiveness of DevOps adoption requires the knowledge of Automation Testing. Automation testing is the management and performance of test activities, to include the development and execution of test scripts so as to verify test requirements, using an automation testing tool. It helps in the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Thus, automation testing has become an indispensable part of quality assurance. Automation testing helps team reduce human error during repetitive testing. In a world where continuous release and testing is increasingly becoming the norm, it is vital that the test activities must be performed accurately and efficiently. Automation testing also reduces time consumption of testing, as it is faster than human testing and an execution can be triggered multiple times immediately one after another and sometimes in parallel.

When automating test cases the selection should be based on the following criteria

- High risk and business critical test cases
- Repeatedly executed test cases
- Test cases which are difficult to perform manually
- Time consuming test cases

##How

Test automation process can be defined as follows

1. Test tool selection
2. Define the scope of selection
3. Planning, design and development
4. Test execution
5. Maintenance

**1. Test tool selection**
Tool selection is the foremost important step that needs to follow as some applications do not support for some tools. It is adivisable to conduct a proof of concept on the application with regards to the test automation tool.

**2. Define the scope of selection**
The scope of the area of the application that intends to conduct test automation should be considered based on the following. - Import features for the business - Areas that have large amount of data - Common functionalities - Technical feasibility - The complexity of test cases - Ability to use the same test cases for cross-browser testing

**3. Planning, design and development**
Automation strategy and plan should be made as follows - Automation tools selected - Framework design and its features - In-Scope and out-scope items of automation - Automation test bed preparation - Schedule and timeline of scripting and execution - Deliverables of test automation

**4. Test execution**
In this phase test automation should be run with test input data and after the execution detailed test reports should be generated

**5. Maintenance**
As new functionalities added automation scripts need to be added, reviewed and maintained for each release cycle.
