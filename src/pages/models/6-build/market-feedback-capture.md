##Why

- To help adjust and improve the product

  - Although the initial market research provided an idea about the user’s needs, only after the customers use the product, we can learn about all the advantages, flaws and their actual experience. Furthermore, the user’s needs and expectations evolve with time continuously. Therefore it is crucial to have mechanisms to capture market feedback in order to ensure that the end product will create the best customer experience.

- To measure customer satisfaction

  - Customer satisfaction is directly linked to business performance. Therefore, we need to make sure our customers are happy with our product. Naturally, capturing their feedback is the best way to find out their level of satisfaction and consequently to predict the business performance in the future. E.g. NPS (Net Promoter Score)

- Collecting feedback shows us value their opinion

  - By asking our customers for feedback (directly), we communicate that their opinion is important to us and they are involved in shaping your product. So they feel more attached to our company and listening to their voice, helps build stronger customer relations.

- A reliable source of information to other customers
  - Positive direct user feedback is a powerful means for marketing the product. Opinions provided by real users who have already used a product are more reliable source for information these days. Hence, many companies today incorporate review system in their services and products. E.g. Uber, AirBnb.

##How

- Indirectly monitoring reactions

  - User experience tracking and analytics
    - There are several tools to measure how the users experience the product. E.g. Google Analytics, mixpanel, hotjar, crazyegg.
  - Usability Tests
    - Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. It gives direct input on how real users use the system. Some different types are A/B testing, Comparative Usability Testing, Explorative Usability Testing and Usability Evaluation. There are also third party services that do such testing. E.g. UserTesting.com.

- Directly gathering responses
  - Surveys
    - Surveys are easy to set up, easy to send out, easy to analyze, and scale very well. We can either use a survey tool (e.g. SurveyMonkey) or incorporate it in our product. However, using surveys exclusively we’ll never understand the deeper reasons behind the user responses. It is good for a starting point.
  - Feedback boxes
    - It is important to have a structured process for capturing direct user feedback in the system. E.g. Feedback forms. Such mechanisms should be simple and easy to use as possible. Then having a process to respond to the feedback is equally important.
  - Reaching out directly
    - Sometimes having a one-to-one discussion is the best way to uncover many opinions. When we’re using surveys, email, or analytics, we’re missing all sorts of contextual information. Unless directly talking to the users, sometimes we’ll never learn what’s really going on, and we’ll be trying to fix the symptom instead of the real problem.
