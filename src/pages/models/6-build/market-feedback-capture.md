description: "The market feedback can be defined as the perceptions (insights/opinions) of the current customers and potential customers about the product. The aim is to capture the way in which the product is regarded, understood, or interpreted by the target markets (groups of users at which the product is aimed). Such feedback information is used as a basis to adjust the product. 
Capturing market feedback can be three fold, as follows;
Direct feedback
Indirect feedback
Inferred feedback"

##Why

- To help adjust and improve the product

  - Although the initial market research provided an idea about the user’s needs, only after the customers use the product, we can learn about all the advantages, flaws and their actual experience. Furthermore, the user’s needs and expectations evolve with time continuously. Therefore it is crucial to have mechanisms to capture market feedback in order to ensure that the end product will create the best customer experience.

- To measure customer satisfaction

  - Customer satisfaction is directly linked to business performance. Therefore, we need to make sure our customers are happy with our product. Naturally, capturing their feedback is the best way to find out their level of satisfaction and consequently to predict the business performance in the future. E.g. NPS (Net Promoter Score)

- Collecting feedback shows us value their opinion

  - By asking our customers for feedback (directly), we communicate that their opinion is important to us and they are involved in shaping your product. So they feel more attached to our company and listening to their voice, helps build stronger customer relations.

- A reliable source of information to other customers
  - Positive direct user feedback is a powerful means for marketing the product. Opinions provided by real users who have already used a product are more reliable source for information these days. Hence, many companies today incorporate review system in their services and products. E.g. Uber, AirBnb.

##How

1. Direct feedback: This is the type of feedback the customers intend to provide to the business. This can be captured at any touch-point in the customer journey whereby the customer expects the business to be listening. Direct feedback, typically, comes in the form of a survey, market research, written complaint, formal letter, or a forum/panel.
   a. Surveys
   Surveys are easy to set up, easy to send out, easy to analyze, and scale very well. We can either use a survey tool (e.g. SurveyMonkey) or incorporate it in our product. However, using surveys exclusively we’ll never understand the deeper reasons behind the user responses. It is good for a starting point.
   b. Feedback boxes
   It is important to have a structured process for capturing direct user feedback in the system. E.g. Feedback forms. Such mechanisms should be simple and easy to use as possible. Then having a process to respond to the feedback is equally important.
   c. Direct meetings/calls
   Sometimes having a one-to-one discussion is the best way to uncover many opinions. When we’re using surveys, email, or analytics, we’re missing all sorts of contextual information. Unless directly talking to the users, sometimes we’ll never learn what’s really going on, and we’ll be trying to fix the symptom instead of the real problem.

2. Indirect feedback: This is the type of feedback which refers to instances when the customer is speaking about the product but does not necessarily have the intention to give feedback to the business. This includes feedback extracted from social networking sites, review sites, customer care interactions conducted via phone, chat sessions, or email.
   a. Website reviews
   A website review is a review conducted by a computer user and published to a review site about the product. Such reviews are commonly provided by consumers who volunteer to write the review, rather than professionals who are paid to evaluate the product or service, and highly regarded by the potential customers when making a decision.
   b. Social media
   Social media feedback occurs when the customers post comments on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and a variety of other social media sites. This feedback is either public or may be limited to the followers of the customer. To find this feedback usually it requires to search on #hashtags or keywords and identify those specific comments that relate to and are relevant to the product/brand or business.
   c. Community Forums
   A forum is an online “meeting place” that is used to engage with others to communicate and share knowledge about a wide range of topics participants are interested in discussing (not necessarily about the product). As it mostly relates to customer experience, a Community Forum is a type of self-service support where customers can find a resolution to their problems without having to contact a customer service agent, thus providing indirect feedback to the business.

3. Inferred feedback: This is feedback derived from transactional, behavioral and operational data associated with the customer experience or the customer journey across different touch-points. Examples of inferred data include website click-stream data, purchase history or contact center data.
   a. Web clickstream data
   Clickstream data are a detailed log of how the users navigate through the Web site during a task. The log typically includes the pages visited, time spent on each page, how they arrived on the page, and where they went next.There are several tools to measure how the users experience the product. E.g. Google Analytics, mixpanel, hotjar, crazyegg.
   b. Purchase history and transactional data  
   This type of feedback is extracted from historical data and is the hardest to capture. This requires analysing patterns of transactional data in order to derive user’s perspectives.
