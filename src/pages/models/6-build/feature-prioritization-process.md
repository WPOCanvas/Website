Feature Prioritization Process

##1. Why?
 

“ What gets done first? How do you decide what features or experiences stay and what gets cut or postponed? Should I listen to customers or my boss when picking features to implement? “



These are some of the most frequent questions development teams are dealing with, and sometimes, with good cause. These kinds of questions show there’s little to none planning and processes for dealing with features.



If we do not select proper features in the planning stage, which need to be in the end product, it takes forever to deliver even an MVP(Minimum Viable Product). And sometimes, valuable time of teams are wasted developing features that no one needs. This can be catastrophic for businesses with limited time and budget, and especially for startups. Ben Yoskowitz, the author of Lean Analytics had this to say :







Building stuff for the sake of building is going to be startup suicide. So, having a rigorous and honest prioritization process for feature development is critical to controlling distraction and eliminating waste.


The Next Feature Fallacy is another problem when there’s no proper process for feature prioritization. That is, hoping that the next feature we add will suddenly make people want to use the entire product. With this mindset, random features get added to the product without actually evaluating the need for such. These features will not add any value to the product, and most of the time, is a waste of time and money.



Considering these points, it’s clear that we need a proper process for feature prioritization in order to overcome such issues. 



##2. Inputs?


Inputs are a list of features, which needs to be prioritized. It is beneficial to know these features in detail, so when it comes to metrics like feasibility and effort, a reasonable response can be given.



##3. Outputs


According to the method used to prioritize the feature set, output can differ from one another. However, in a general sense, we will be getting a list of features with the appropriate priority values assigned to them. Some models use numerical values, and others use categories for prioritization.



##4. How?


There are numerous ways to do feature prioritization and there are pros and cons to each technique as well. We will not be exploring every method in this context, as it defies the purpose of this learning material. Instead, an overview of these methods is explained below.



A nice layout with most of feature prioritization methods is produced by Daniel Zacarias.

Here, X axis tracks how much each model depends on data and opinions from people external to the core product development team. What this essentially explains is the fact that sometimes we need involvement from the outside( End users or other stakeholders) to help with prioritization. But, in other cases, we might want to follow a simpler process with the development team.



Y axis represents how much each model relies on expert(personal) opinions instead of some kind of a metric, classification voting or ranking. Some people are more comfortable in working with numbers, and sometimes they prefer qualitative measures. And sometimes, what we are trying to capture might not be quantifiable, qualitative measures help in those instances.



This layout provides a high level overview of how each model operates, so it is easier to choose which model to use in respective cases. Every product is not the same, so feature prioritization should be considered as a very subjective matter. By carefully figuring out what combination suits the product and the team best, we can try out a couple of these models.



However, it’s good to have a general idea about the models named here, so go to the listed references to read more about these prioritization techniques and what they offer, so the model selection can be further fine tuned.
