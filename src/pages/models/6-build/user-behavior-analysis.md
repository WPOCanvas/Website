## why
User behavior analytics (UBA) is the tracking and assessing of how users make use of the features provided. Data collection and analysis is primarily done through automated monitoring systems where manual intervention may be required in decision making. UBA is important to know:
  - What features users are mostly interested and caring
  - Where do they get stuck and having troubles with
  - What sections are performing better in delivering value to users
  - What sections are ignored by users, can be removed, pivoted to keep the product simple and efficient
  - Detect abnormal user behaviors such as heavy usage, unauthorized access, data tampering, insider threats, etc.

With UBA, you no longer have to do guess work or take decisions based on opinions. Your decisions on product roadmap and improvements becomes objective and data driven.

## how
- Understand the type of tools that can be employed to track user behavior. There are multiple tool categories such as:
  - Activity heat maps
  - Funnel views of user journey
  - Counting of user events
  - Session recordings
  - Security triggers and alarms
- Document the type of actionable insights that must be derived from the tools and perform the tool integrations accordingly.
- Keep user users informed of the type of data collected and obtain concent to avoid privacy violations
- Set up a visualization dashboard and reports for easy interpretation of the insights
- Set up a routine process with relevant stakeholders to review and take actions based on the collected data
- Make it a practice to refer to the collected data in requirement related meetings such as backlog grooming, roadmap discussions, etc.
