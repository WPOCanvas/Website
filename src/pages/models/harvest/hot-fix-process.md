##Why? 


The term "hotfix" originally referred to software patches that were applied to "hot" systems; that is, systems which are live, currently running, and in production status rather than development status. For the developer, a hotfix implies that the change may have been made quickly and outside normal development and testing processes. This could increase the cost of the fix by requiring rapid development, overtime or other urgent measures. For the user, the hotfix could be considered riskier or less likely to resolve the problem. This could cause an immediate loss of services, so depending on the severity of the bug, it may be desirable to delay a hotfix. The risk of applying the hotfix must be weighed against the risk of not applying it, because the problem to be fixed might be so critical that it could be considered more important than a potential loss of service (e.g., a major security breach).

##How to Determine? 


Hotfix (or patch) releases are not preplanned and are made to address critical issues with the current release. The criteria and process below are set as a guideline to help determine what is a hotfix. A hotfix is a significant bug that affects the majority of users for which there is no reasonable workaround.



##So consider these questions:



##Is this bug significant?
Does it produces incorrect results?
Are there compile or runtime errors with valid input?
Is there major incorrect functionality?


##Does it affect the majority of users?
Does the bug affect a common or major function?
Is the input that causes the bug a common or edge case?
Will the average user encounter the bug during normal, average usage?


##Is there a reasonable workaround?
Is there even a workaround?
Can a potential workaround be communicated effectively to the community?
Will the average user understand the workaround?
How many steps/code changes does a workaround take?
When the bug is fixed, does the workaround continue to work?


Also consider the timing of when the next release is scheduled. If the freeze or release date is within a few days, consider waiting and including the hotfix in the next release instead.
