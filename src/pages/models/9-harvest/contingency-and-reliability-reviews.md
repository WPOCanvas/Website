description: "It is easily to get carried away with demanding daily tasks especially when you operate a growing business. However, contingency planning has to be a part of any business continuity process of a company. Worst could happen at any time and if not planned properly everything could be lost literally overnight.

Contingency planning basically means putting a plan in place to continue the business as much as normal in an event of an unplanned condition. Those who have proactively invested on such a plan are more likely to avoid a big disaster when a rainy day comes."
