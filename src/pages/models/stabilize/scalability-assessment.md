In the modern application development cycle feedback loop is very important.
Flow and feedback loop will help the team to measure different aspects in various stages of application development
Incorporate monitoring tools and processes as early as possible in the development of your application. Monitoring is about more than just production performance: You must be aware of the health of the application at all stages of development. By monitoring earlier in the process you will gain valuable insight into the application before it goes to production, making it easier to correlate and compare how the application behaved in test environments and in production.
Measure to determine which features in your application are most valuable and which are at least valuable. Many features and functions are never used. They're expensive to maintain and make innovation more difficult, effectively slowing down your team.
Figure out how to measure and track the business value that the application enables and delivers. This information is crucial when business and IT leaders prioritize future investments and make the inevitable trade-offs that arise. Rapid innovation in this part of your business could be a competitive advantage that disrupts your competition.
