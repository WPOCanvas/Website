## Why
It is not easy to handle and pay attention to all research conducted in a process. Therefore Persona will be the most realistic approach since it represents the image of a typical user. It can also remind us of the user’s needs and help us to create a better user experience model it will make users feel comfortable while using the product. And this is how it facilitates development. Personas demonstrate the goals and requirements of users, the axis of the work for the UX design group, which will make the first version of the product come with a better usability design. With Personas, when it appears conflict of design, the design group can adapt their decision based on the model. Personas can help the group develop the most useful features instead of designing features that will never be used. Personas will also help the product team figure out the essential design element.

## How

#### The team can gather with the stakeholders of the product to define the input areas of the persona mentioned below

- Research your target audience :
  The first step is to take a closer look at your data gathered in Discovery Phase, mainly User Interview. Tag your most essential insights, primarily problems.

- Narrow down the most common details :
  Identify trends, you should understand that different groups of people have a novel approach to the subject.

- Create separate personas :
  All of the main Personas templates consists of following main elements.

  - Photo : To emphasize the age and experience attached to this Persona
  - Name : Each Persona should have a unique name.
  - Persona Group : Describess what user group represents by this persona. i.e Administrator or Customer
  - Description : A place to summarize your personas. It should include the background of your fictional character, as well as their current desires
  - Job titles and major responsibilities: Identify what job titles are represented by this persona and what are their respossibilities.
  - Demographics: Describe demographics such as age, education, ethnicity, and family status
  - Problems : Every Persona represents different problems. Add all of them to this section to have a summary of the personal struggle. A quote that sums up what   matters most to the persona as it relates to your application. 
  - Goals: The goals and tasks they are trying to complete using the application
  - Pain points: Specific problems that prospective customers of your business are experiencing

- Give your personas names :
  The best way to write for and think about your buyer persona is to give them a name. Assigning a name to your persona will remind you that you’re speaking to an actual person when you write emails. This can help you write more personalized content.

- Identify goals & painpoints
  It is extremely critical to discover unmet user needs through research for both personas and jobs-to-be-done. Any unmet needs will always have two components:
  - Goals: What you want to accomplish and why you want to accomplish it.
  - Pain points: What stopped you from accomplishing it. 
  Understanding the pain points is to understand what actually stops people from achieving their goals. One thing we tend to forget when we jump to the solution phase is that understanding pain points of your target user is as important as understanding the goals they try to achieve. Sometimes, there are products or services on the market that can help customers achieve their goals but still provide little value to them.

- Benifit of a persona
  Since not all of your users share the same pain points but they may need the same goal, it helps you differentiate, select, and prioritize who you will design for. Identifying correct persona is critical when creating customer journey maps and to validate a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) scope for product engineers.
