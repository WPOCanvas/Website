description: "
Let's think of a product's USP (Unique Selling Points). Why do companies come up with this? Why is it necessary to define this?
 
Simple because, in a crowded market, customers get overwhelmed with so many reasons why they should buy a certain product or a service. In order to make this less complicated and more simple, so that the customer can link their needs/wants to what is offered in a product or service, organizations define the most unique selling points. These unique selling points are derived from a product/service value proposition.
