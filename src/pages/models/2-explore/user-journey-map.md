description: "User journey map is a visualization of an individual’s experience with a product or service over time and across different perspectives. Mapping these experiences is a key part of being a human-centered business, and it is important to look at both perspectives — what the person experiences, and what went on outside of their view to make it happen. Customer journey mapping and service blueprinting are two complementary methods that can help us see both sides of our services.
Yet these two methods are often confused; what is a journey map, and what is a service blueprint, and how are they different."

## Why
  User journey map helps a product team to find the answer to the “What if..?” questions. Also, a user journey map can be helpful when the company tracks quantitative KPIs. In this case, a user journey map has an opportunity to become a cornerstone for strategic recommendations.
  What journey maps and customer narratives don’t show is the internal workings of the organization. The service blueprint seeks to uncover and document (often for the first time!) all the things that go on beneath the surface and the internal makeup of the organization that creates it. It is data visualization of how your company works; the deep, dark inner workings of how the things a customer experiences are actually produced.

- User journey map
  - User journey map is an excellent tool for UX designers because It visualizes how a user interacts with a product and allows designers to see a product from a user’s point of view This fosters a more user-centric approach to product design, which ultimately leads to better user experience.

- Service blue print
  - Where journey mapping focuses on exposing the end-to-end of your customer’s front stage experience, blueprinting focuses on exposing the surface-to-core of the business that makes up the backstage and behind the scenes of how you deliver and operate, and ties that to the customer’s experience.

## How
  Lets understand the context. We need to understand the notion of “the stage” in service design, a cornerstone concept that is essential for understanding the difference between customer journeys and service blueprints. “The stage” is comprised of three perspectives.
  1. the front stage - Customer will interact with the product or service from the front stage
  2. the backstage - The backstage is where all the support processes live that produce the front stage, invisible to the customer.
  3. behind-the-scenes - All the intangible processes such as rules, regulations take place.

### Journey Map
A journey map captures iconic experiences that customers have, from their point of view; the front stage of the service experience. In creating a journey map, you use customer narratives and customer data to plot their experience over time, mapping what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, and what they are interacting with along the way.

- Identify the User Flows.
  - The steps that the user will take to achieve his goals. Can be the main or sub flows.These will be the series of activities.

- The Persona which interacts with the journey.
  - What personas interacts with the main journey at a certain point.

- The Behaviors & Interactions of the particular user.
  - What the persona does in a particular step. What are the actions taken by them.

- The Pain points.
  - What the hardships / obstacles the persona has to go through to achieve his goal.

-  Rewards presented to the user.
  - What are the incentives given to the user to overcome pain points.

- The Emotions, user might feel at this point.
  - What kind of emotions the user might get at a particular step. 

- The Expected Outcome.
  - If all things goes well what would be the expected result of the particular step you are focusing. 

- The Web Components.

  - The UI components which can be used in the interface. This may be updated at any time in the process.

### Service blueprint
What journey maps and customer narratives don’t show is the internal workings of the organization to offer the product or service. The service blueprint seeks to uncover and document all the things that go on beneath the surface and the internal makeup of the organization that creates it. It is data visualization of how your product or service works, the deep dark inner workings of how the things a customer experiences are actually produced.

- Understand end-to-end journeys
  - These scenarios should be based in the customer journey, but can also include organizational scenarios that happen internally away from the customer’s view.

- Identify the back stage process
  - By going deep into each step in the scenario, you can expose the breadth and depth of the experience that supports and produces the stage where the journey takes place. This process relies on a cross-functional collaboration between different parts of the organization, in order to represent all aspects of the external and internal experience

- Identify behind the scenes processes
  - Behind-the-scenes, where all the intangible things that the organization must do to make both the front and backstage possible. Rules, regulations, policies, budgets; all the things that aren’t really a part of either the front or back stage.
