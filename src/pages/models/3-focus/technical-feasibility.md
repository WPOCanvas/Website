description: "Technical feasibility assessment focuses on the technical resources available to the organization. It helps organizations determine whether the technical resources meet capacity and whether the technical team is capable of converting the ideas into working systems. Technical feasibility also involves the evaluation of the hardware, software, and other technical requirements of the proposed system."

## Why

The problem with technology is that everything works perfectly on marketing slides, but when you get the technology in-house it is often a very different story. As a result, alternatives for each technology, if any, should be identified. Note that to do a reasonable assessment that you may need to do a mini-project and build a proof-of-concept prototype that verifies that the technologies work together

## How

Some issues to consider when determining technical feasibility.

- Technology Issues

  - Performance
  - Ease of learning
  - Ease of deployment
  - Ease of support
  - Operational characteristics (i.e. can it run 7 days a week, 24 hours a day?)
  - Interoperability with your other key technologies
  - Scalability

- Market Issues

  - Vendor viability (i.e. is it likely that they will be in business in two years? In five?)
  - Alternate sources for the technology, if any
  - Third-party support for related products and services
  - Level of support provided by the vendor
  - Industry mindshare of the product (i.e. is the market gravitating toward or away from this technology?)
