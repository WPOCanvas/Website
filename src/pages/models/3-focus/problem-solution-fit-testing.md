description: "According to a post mortem research of global startups conducted by the venture capital database [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/), the most common reason why new ventures fail is because they build and launch something customers donâ€™t want. The problem solution fit is all about identifying an existing problem and to solve it with a solution that customers find useful and satisfying. It is the evidance that a product, or a service solves a customer's problem."

##Why
Because it shows us that our product has the potential of scaling, and getting to product-market fit. Before investing months or years of effort towards building a product, the first step is determining if this product is something worth doing.

##How

- You have already built an MVP (minimum viable product),
- You have found your early adopters (people to use your MVP),
- You have managed to solve a problem that your early adopters have,
- You have managed to charge enough for your solution so that users are happy.
