## Why
Technical architecture helps product teams to make decisions for the product respecting the system goals, functional and non-functional requirements defined by the stakeholders or the domain. 

## How
Technical architecture is defined in a document which layouts the functional and non-functional requirements of the product. It typically includes,
- Background
- Requirements
  - Functional (What the system should do?)
  - Non-Functional (With what should the system deal? E.g. Performance, Load, Data Volumes, SLA etc...)
- Executive Summary
- Architecture Overview
  - Diagrams
  - Technology stack (E.g. Data store, Backend, Frontend)
  - Deployment platform (E.g. AWS cloud, Digital Ocean etc...)
  - DevOps Process
