##What
Product architecture defines the different sub-components of a software system, and how the interact with each other, whereas platform architecture defines the underlying infrastructure on which the software system runs.



##Why
Platform architecture constraints but may not necessarily determine the application architecture.
Impact on cost
Since we’re talking about infrastructure here, there’s a direct relationship between the chosen platform architecture and cost of setting up and maintaining it.
<< Include a reference of the relationship between different architectures and the setup/maintenance cost with time >>
Maintenance effort
Again, since we’re talking about infrastructure here, there’s a direct relationship between the chosen platform architecture and the maintenance effort.
<< Include a reference of the relationship between different architectures and the setup/maintenance effort with time >>
The choice of platform architecture is done at the very early stages, at most times, that choice is irreversible.


##How
Since the amount of information that we have at the time decide upon the application is very little and could be inaccurate as well, it’s important that we make the right decision.
