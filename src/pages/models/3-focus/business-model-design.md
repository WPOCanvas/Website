In other words, it answers the question of how a company CREATES VALUE for ITSELF while delivering products or services to its customers. The traditional business model consists of nine cells that capture all aspects of a business.

##Why
To initiate a new business or operate an existing business it is important to understand the complexity and internal workings of the business. This understanding will enable managers to fine-tune their offerings to maximize profitability. For a startup, this understanding is important to evaluate the viability of the business idea. A business contains various touchpoints which makes it very hard to comprehend. As such it has become very important that the business is synthesized in a simple understandable format. The business model canvas serves as a document that summarises how a business owner is planning to create value(profit) by offering services and products to customers. It also serves as a base document to explain how the company plans to make a profit thus attracting investors. In a nutshell, the business model canvas is an A4 paper sized document synthesizing the business.

##How

Building a business model follows a procedure of filling in each cell in the canvas in predefined order as mentioned below. When filling in each cell one must answer some critical questions. When answered in the order described, the business can operations is elaborated in simple terms.

- Value Proposition: What are you building for your customers? What pain are you solving and what gain are you creating? What is unique about you that makes you stand out in the market? This is the place where you list all of your features, products or services describes as value to customers.

So far the right side of the business model is defined. It will give answers to what the company plans to produce, how it plans to deliver and to whom it plans to deliver. This half is the outward-facing side of the business which focuses on the customer needs and explains how the revenue streams are created.

- Key Resources: What key assets and resources are required to run the business? From a software product perspective, some of the key resources could be people and intellectual property rights
- Key Partners: Who do we need to outside our business to help us operate the business?
- Key Activities: What are the most important things need to be done to make the business model work?
- Cost Structure: What are the costs and expenses to operate the business

Now the left side of the business model is defined. The left section is inward-facing and focusses on how the company plans to create products or services and who are the key resources and partners. This will explain the internal working of a business. All of this will boil down to the overall cost of operation which is explained as cost structure.
