##What?
Minimum viable product encompasses the least number of features necessary to realize the core value proposition of your product or to maximize the learnability. In other words, this means that this is the minimum feature set required to learn the success of the product offering.



##Why?
The main intention of an MVP is to test the market. So, you can build the least amount features required to deliver your value proposition. This allows flexibility in a situation where you want to change requirements and in case your idea fails in front of the customer, then you know that with least amount of effort. The main value of the MVP is to build a product immediately, while cutting cost and in an unfortunate event of product going south, fail fast.

MVP allows us to venture into a cycle of continuous improvement by moving into a build, measure and learn cycle. This allows us to show the business strength to get stakeholder buy-in and walk the talk.



##How?
Vision & success criteria: First step to build the MVP is to identify the overall vision of the product. Once you have a good idea about the vision then define a success criterion to measure it.



Breakdown features: At this stage the large vision needs to be broken down into more tangible areas where impact on each feature can be assessed individually.



#Identify ROI: The ROI of each feature is considered by comparing the learnability against cost.

The success criteria of the MVP will be determined by maximizing the inclusions from high learnability, low cost quadrant.



#Roadmap: The selected features then needs to be placed in a MVP roadmap
