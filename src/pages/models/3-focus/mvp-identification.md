##Why
The main intention of an MVP is to test the market. So, you can build the least amount of features required to deliver your value proposition. It allows flexibility in a situation where you want to change requirements, and in case your idea fails in front of the customer, then you know that with the least amount of effort. The primary value of the MVP is to build a product immediately while cutting costs, and in an unfortunate event of product going south, fail fast.

##How

- Vision & success criteria
  The First step to build the MVP is to identify the overall vision of the product. Once you have a good idea about the vision, then define a success criterion to measure it.

- The breakdown features
  At this stage, the broad vision needs to be broken down into more tangible areas where the impact of each feature can be assessed individually.

- Identify ROI
  The ROI of each feature is considered by comparing the learnability against cost. The success criteria of the MVP will be determined by maximizing the inclusions from high learnability, low cost quadrant.

- Roadmap
  The selected features then needs to be placed in a MVP roadmap.
